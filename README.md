-Final Year Major Project
- HEALTH CARE ASSISTANT AID
- Our application is a dedicated assistance app tailored to meet the unique needs of nurses working in casualty wards when doctors may not be readily available. In these circumstances, the app serves as a reliable resource for primary medications and first aid, enabling nurses to provide essential care swiftly and effectively. This initiative aims not only to enhance the overall quality of patient care but also to streamline communication between nurses and doctors, ensuring that crucial information is conveyed promptly, even in the absence of direct physical presence.
